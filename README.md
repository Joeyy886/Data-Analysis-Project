## **üìä Projects**
Here are my data analysis projects:

1. **Thesis Project** ‚Äì *(Explore weight loss discussions and sentiments on Reddit)*  
This study investigates the weight loss discussions and sentiments on Reddit during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study collected and analyzed a dataset containing 35,384 posts from March 2019 to March 2021 in the loseit subreddit. To compare and explore how discussions and sentiments changed within this weight loss subreddit, the analysis utilized two unsupervised machine learning methods, topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to explore the evolution of the topics and emotional expressions of weight loss discussions over time. By employing topic modeling (LDA), the study identified 16 topics within five categories of weight loss discussions: Weight Management, Diet, Physical Exercise, Emotions and Support, and Appearance. However, topic related weight loss as well as upstream and downstream such as Weight change (T2), Calorie tracker (T3), Motivation (T4) and Workout plan (T15) varied over time. Furthermore, Sentiment analysis indicated that discussions in the loseit subreddit are mainly positive rather than negative. There was a slight increase in negative sentiments and a decrease in positive throughout the study period. Emotion analysis indicates the complexity of the emotion dynamic in weight loss discussions. Moreover, users in this weight loss subreddit frequently expressed positive emotions, such as anticipation, and negative emotions, such as fear. However, the sentiments and emotions varied significantly among most topics. These findings reveal how social media affected netizens' attitudes and behaviour on this topic and how it changed during this global crisis. While the study noted significant sentiment changes in some topics across the two time periods in this weight loss subreddit, it remains cautious about concluding the impact of the pandemic in weight loss discussion on social media. Further study could explore a more extended period in multiple subreddits or social media platforms to conclusively link these trends with the pandemic's effect.

2. **Course Project** ‚Äì *(Analyze Netflix Series Data)*  
The project involves scraping data from the webpage titled ‚Äú100 Best Netflix Series to watch right now (May
2023)‚Äù on Rotten Tomatoes which is a polpular website that provides aggregated reviews and ratings for
movies and TV shows. The specific URL of the webpage is ‚Äúhttps://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/
best-netflix-shows-and-movies-to-binge-watch-now/‚Äù. This webpage focuses on the Netflix series, which
contains a list of the top 100 series as recommended by Rotten Tomatoes. Each series entry includes
information such as the title, genre, year of release, actor, ranking etc.
By extracting the above information about the Netflix series listed on the webpage, a comprehensive data
set of the top 100 Netflix series is gathered to analyze the genre popularity and understand the audience
preference on Netflix into most highly regarded series according to Rotten Tomatoes. Furthermore, it can
also be helpful for viewers, content creators, and Netflix itself in making informed decisions about the types
of series to watch, produce, or promote.
