## **📊 Projects**
Here are my data analysis projects:

1. **Thesis Project** – *(Explore weight loss discussions and sentiments on Reddit)*  

2. **Course Project** – *(Analyze Netflix Series Data)*  
The project involves scraping data from the webpage titled “100 Best Netflix Series to watch right now (May
2023)” on Rotten Tomatoes which is a polpular website that provides aggregated reviews and ratings for
movies and TV shows. The specific URL of the webpage is “https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/
best-netflix-shows-and-movies-to-binge-watch-now/”. This webpage focuses on the Netflix series, which
contains a list of the top 100 series as recommended by Rotten Tomatoes. Each series entry includes
information such as the title, genre, year of release, actor, ranking etc.
By extracting the above information about the Netflix series listed on the webpage, a comprehensive data
set of the top 100 Netflix series is gathered to analyze the genre popularity and understand the audience
preference on Netflix into most highly regarded series according to Rotten Tomatoes. Furthermore, it can
also be helpful for viewers, content creators, and Netflix itself in making informed decisions about the types
of series to watch, produce, or promote.

3. **Personal Project** – *(E-commerce Sales Analysis)*
